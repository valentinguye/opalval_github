/*
This script merges together the spreadsheets used for manual geolocalization. 
Then, it makes manual modifications to resolve conflicts (mill name or coordinates duplicates).

It needs: 

"noto_done.xls", "Sheet1"
"mills_to_georeference_pre2011_done.xlsx", "Mills to georef"
"mills_to_georeference_post2010_done.xlsx", "mills to georef"
"traseMills_capEstyear.xlsx", "traseMills_capEstyear"
"IBS_PO_98_15_cleaned.dta"




Put everything back together with the coordinates.

For this purpose, the first step is tÃ´ prepare (in a .dta harmonized format) all the Excel spreadsheets containing the outputs of the manual works. 

	- oto is already in .dta from R file, it was not processed in an excel format. 
	- for noto, pre2011 and post2010 we want to check for each subset that there is only one mill_name and one coordinate value within firm_id
		(Duplicated mill_name and coordinate value across firm_id will be checked later, once they are all together.)
	- unref is in Excel cross-sectional format, with matched trase_code (named mill_id originally) and without coordinates, so this is to be fixed.
